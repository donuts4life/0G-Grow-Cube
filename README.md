# 0G-Grow-Cube
0 Gravity plant growing chamber for the Grow Beyond Earth Maker Challange

There is lots of work still to be done before plants go in this cube.  Some of the photos here are for a single row test stand to test 
light didtance and wavelength.  The python code here is very basic just to pump the water, run the fan, and turn the lights on and off.  
Right now I am running them as individual scripts run from Crontab.  The next item to add is a camera to automatically take photos daily.
THis will allow me to trach the growth of the plants as I make adjustments to watering and light cycles.
